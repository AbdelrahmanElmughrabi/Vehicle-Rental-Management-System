# Vehicle Rental Management System

A Java-based vehicle rental management system that handles different types of vehicles including cars and trucks. The system supports both customer and administrator operations.
 This project was one of the projects I have created in my learning process to master OOP in java.

- Book vehicles 
- Cancel bookings
- Rent vehicles

- Load cargo (for loadable vehicles)

### Administrator Operations

### Vehicle Types

  - Transport Trucks

### Key Functionality
- Vehicle booking and rental management
- Loading capacity checks for cargo vehicles
- Remote delivery and drop-off for supported vehicles
- Exception handling for overweight cargo and booking cancellations

## Project Structure
The project follows object-oriented design with inheritance hierarchies for vehicles and interfaces for specialized capabilities like loading cargo and remote delivery.
